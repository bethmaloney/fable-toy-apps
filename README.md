# Fable Toy Apps

This a is a collection of small projects demonstrating technologies related to [Fable](https://fable.io/).

## Projects

* [Elmish React Counter](elmish-react-counter) - A simple counter implemented using React Hooks instead of Elmish. Only the Elmish React bindings are used. State management is 100% React

* [Feliz Counter](feliz-counter) - A simple counter implemented using [Feliz](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz) which provides a nicer easier to to use React DSL then the one that comes with Fable. No Elmish at all.
